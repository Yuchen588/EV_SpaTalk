Description: Extracellular vesicles (EVs), produced by all eukaryotic cells, are essential for intercellular communication. Beyond transporting internal cargo, EVs transfer specific ligands from donor to receptors on recipient cells, playing a crucial role in orchestrating intercellular dynamics and modulating the biological landscape of human ecosystem. However, inferring EV-driven tissue-cellular interactome presents a challenge. To address this, we introduce EV_SpaTalk, an innovative framework designed to infer the significance of ligand-receptor pairs in EV-mediated cell-cell crosstalk networks within tumor microenvironments. This framework relies on EV budding power, a key cellular state in ESCRT+ cells, and the spatial interoperable extrapolation of EV-specific ligand-receptor pairs. EV_SpaTalk models the ligand-receptor signaling network between spatially adjacent sender-receiver niches, utilizing a non-negative linear model and spatial distance mapping to decompose cell components from spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) and paired single-cell RNA-seq data. This framework efficiently deciphers EV-driven ligand-receptor interactions across various cell types, offering an invaluable tool for researchers to investigate intricate EV-mediated spatial cell dynamics in tissue, thereby significantly enhancing our understanding of EVs' roles in cellular communication and tumor biology.
